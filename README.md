# Introduction:

Our team, Xorbians, hopes to achieve a scalable, deployable, and maintainable Face Detection and Validation product for HackRx. Keeping in mind the above three factors, we surveyed and enlisted state-of-the-art modules supported and backed by Open Source and well-maintained products such as Tensorflow, FastAPI, and OpenCV.
